# School Data Cleaning for Google Looker Studio Dashboard

This repository contains two Jupyter notebooks aimed at cleaning and visualizing school data for integration into a 
Google Looker Studio Dashboard. The data used in these notebooks are sourced from various platforms including 
[Education Data Explorer](https://educationdata.urban.org/data-explorer), 
[Civil Rights Data](https://civilrightsdata.ed.gov/), and the 
[U.S. Department of Education](https://www2.ed.gov/about/inits/ed/edfacts/data-files/index.html)
